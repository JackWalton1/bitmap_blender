After losing my entire virtual machine to a hard disk corruption....
Did my best in blendimages2.c to make pixel array, so I could work on interpolate. 
I never got to interpolate because the pixel array gave me so much trouble.
Once I started writing to the file via arrays, I got tons of bugs. Padded images would come 
out in different colors. Could not blend lion and wolf at all anymore 
and, in the case of the ladder, recieved error:
    malloc(): corrupted top size
    zsh: abort
